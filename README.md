# URM
In this project I will teach you the Uniform Rectilinear Movement with Minecraft projectiles

# What is Uniform Rectilinear Movement (URM)?

It is a type of motion in which an object moves in a straight line at a constant speed for a certain period of time. The speed is constant, meaning there is no acceleration and no changes in the object's speed or direction during the motion. This constant speed can be described using the equation d = vt, where "d" is the distance traveled, "v" is the constant speed, and "t" is the elapsed time.

# How will we code it today?

Today we will use [Nukkit](https://cloudburstmc.org/articles/) as software to run our program to calculate the URM, we will also use the entities from [Projectiles](https://minecraft-archive.fandom.com/wiki/Category:Projectiles) which have an in-game URM, from the position you launch it to where it lands.
